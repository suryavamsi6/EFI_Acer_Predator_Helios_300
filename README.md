### Hackintosh EFI for Acer Predator Helios 300 (Macos Big Sur)

I Highly Recommend you to build the EFI for your device on your own and only use this for reference even though you have the same device as mine since,  when something fails you will be on your own. It's better to have some knowledge on the files instead of just copy pasting it.

*This EFI was used for Mac OS Big Sur. It should work with older mac os versions as well but may need few tweaks.*
