# EFI_Acer_Predator_Helios_300
Hackintosh EFI for Acer Predator Helios 300

I Highly Recommend you to build the EFI for your device on your own and only use this for reference even though you have the same device as when something fails you have to fix it on your own.
This EFI was used for Mac OS Big Sur. It should work with older mac os versions as well but may need few tweaks.
